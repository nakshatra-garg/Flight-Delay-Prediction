# Flight-Delay-Prediction
Anyone who has ever booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the flight timing varies. Airlines use using sophisticated tactics which they call "yield management". According to a recent study, India is currently the 3rd largest civil aviation market in the world. According to IATA (International Air Transport Association) the number of flyers globally could double to 8.2 billion in 2037. Nowadays, in this ever advancing world time management has become a prominent factor in all business operations. We canâ€™t afford to lose time on unnecessary delays. Using this as motivation we have developed a ML Model which predicts arrival flight delay based on various factors that include airport score, general airline trend, air traffic etc. The reasons for these delays vary a lot going from air congestion to weather conditions, mechanical problems, difficulties while boarding passengers, and simply the airlines inability to handle the demand given its capacity. By using Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms we can try to predict if your flight will be delayed in many ways. Of course, all of these different algorithms will have pitfalls and a certain degree of accuracy which will be associated to the data that they are fed.
